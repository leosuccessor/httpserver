# httpserver
"This repository contains an HTTP server written in C, developed as a project for CSE 130 - Principles of Computer Systems Design class. The server is capable of handling multiple client requests simultaneously and can serve static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The server also supports basic HTTP methods like GET, POST, and HEAD. It is a simple yet functional implementation of an HTTP server and can be used as a starting point for building more complex web applications."
